Ray predicts this will be the dawning of a new civilization in which we will no longer be dependent on our physical bodies, we will be trillions of times more intelligent and there will be no clear distinction between human and machine, real reality and virtual reality. Human aging and illness will be reversed; world hunger and poverty will be solved and we will ultimately cure death. Critics accuse Ray of being too optimistic and argue that the dangers of the Singularity far outweigh the benefits, pointing out the apocalyptic implications that once machines achieve consciousness, we may not be able to control them. Whether Rays controversial ideas incite excitement or fear, dogma or disbelief this ambitious documentary will forever change the way you look at life, death, and your own future.",Documentary

But Heart is no match for the array of odd, ill-tempered, or outright grotesque witnesses he encounters. In a string of show-stopping performances including John Fleck (Murder One, Falling Down, Carnivale, and one of the NEA four) as Brad the rabid office manager, Susan Tyrrell (Cry Baby, Andy Warhol's Bad, and Oscar nominated for Fat City) as the neighbor with the bacterial face lift, and Mink Stole (Pink Flamingos, Serial Mom, Female Trouble) as Dolores's icy mother, Heart moves through some the stranger precincts of Los Angeles. He is bullied by a dental receptionist with a fetish for ax murderers, struggles to keep up with Riverwalkers as they march through the bone-dry L.A. River, and just what does the dead goldfish in the bowl mean? In the end he is no closer to the truth than when he started. And Donder has to go on vacation.
